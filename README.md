# Hey, I'm Albert 👋

I'm into AI automation — basically figuring out how to make LLMs and agents do useful work instead of just chatting. Most of my stuff is in Python.

## What I'm working on

Right now I'm exploring a few different angles:

- **LangChain** for building chains and agents that can actually handle real tasks
- - **CrewAI** for getting multiple agents to work together (still figuring this one out honestly)
  - - **AutoGen** because Microsoft's approach to multi-agent conversations is pretty interesting
    - - **RAG pipelines** — hooking up LLMs to real documents so they stop making things up
      - - Building out reusable tools for **data extraction** and **API integrations**
       
        - ## My repos
       
        - Here's what I've got going on — most of these are works in progress:
       
        - | Repo | What it's for |
        - |---|---|
        - | [langchain-ai-automation](https://github.com/AlbertMein/langchain-ai-automation) | LangChain agents, chains, RAG pipelines |
        - | [crewai-multi-agent-systems](https://github.com/AlbertMein/crewai-multi-agent-systems) | Multi-agent setups with CrewAI |
        - | [autogen-agent-framework](https://github.com/AlbertMein/autogen-agent-framework) | Playing around with AutoGen conversations |
        - | [rag-document-processing](https://github.com/AlbertMein/rag-document-processing) | RAG stuff — vector DBs, embeddings, search |
        - | [ai-api-integration](https://github.com/AlbertMein/ai-api-integration) | Wrappers for OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc. |
        - | [data-extraction-automation](https://github.com/AlbertMein/data-extraction-automation) | Scraping + LLM-powered data extraction |
        - | [ai-automation-templates](https://github.com/AlbertMein/ai-automation-templates) | Starter templates so I don't keep rewriting boilerplate |
       
        - ## Tools I use a lot
       
        - **Frameworks:** LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex
       
        - **LLM APIs:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI
       
        - **Vector DBs:** Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate
       
        - **Other stuff:** Python, FastAPI, Docker, Pandas
       
        - ## What I'm learning
       
        - Honestly, this space moves so fast it's hard to keep up. Currently trying to get better at:
       
        - - Agent memory and long-running tasks
          - - Making RAG actually work well (it's harder than it looks)
            - - Keeping API costs from getting out of hand
              - - Deploying this stuff in production without everything breaking
               
                - ## Get in touch
               
                - If you're working on similar things or want to collaborate, feel free to open an issue on any of my repos or reach out. Always happy to chat about this stuff.
